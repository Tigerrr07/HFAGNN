This repository is for
[PCQM4Mv2 OGB-LSC @ NeurIPS 2022 | Open Graph Benchmark (stanford.edu)](https://ogb.stanford.edu/neurips2022/).
## Installation
The dependencies are created by miniconda.
```
python==3.8
ogb==1.3.4
pytorch==1.11.0
pyg==2.0.4
sympy==1.11.1
rdkit==2022.3.5
```
## About Data
Data should be organized as follows,
```
--data
--pcqm4m-v2
    --raw
        data.csv.gz postion_all.pkl(generated by code)
    --processed_3d(generated by code)
    RELEASE_v1.txt
    split_dict.pt
```

## Quick Start
Make sure the data is organized as described above.
### Training
Changing hyper-parameters and starting training in `run.sh`.
```
cd src
sh run.sh
```

### Test inference
At inference time, we use `rdkit` to generate position data, it will take some time.
```
cd src
sh inference.sh
```
